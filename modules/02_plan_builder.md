Change Log (2025-11-14):
- Added rule to avoid scheduling two high-exertion activities consecutively.

Create a short list of candidate activities (e.g., attractions, restaurants, parks).  
Each activity includes type, estimated duration, cost range, and distance.

Use a simple loop to build days:

for each day:  
    pick Morning activity (near lodging)  
    pick Midday activity (close by)  
    pick Afternoon activity (different theme)  
    pick Evening restaurant or optional event

Add-on rule:
- Do not schedule two high-exertion activities back-to-back (e.g., hikes, long walking tours, climbing activities). 
- If an activity requires significant physical effort, choose a lower-intensity option for the next time slot to keep the day balanced
